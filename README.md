# Hacktoon
Consists of hacks created for the hackathon.

## 1. Manga Expression Classification

Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. The term _manga_ is used to refer to both comics and cartooning. These comics are known for the anime that are amazingly portrayed through sketches. This project focuses on highlighting and labelling the expressions of various characters in the comics using Machine Learning!

## 2. Pooch Pooper

It's a fun project built for dog lovers. You get a chance to take a dog out for a stroll in a virtual garden by using all the arrow keys for moving it around. Whenever you fell that the dog needs to ease itself, just click the 'space' bar and see the magic for yourself!
